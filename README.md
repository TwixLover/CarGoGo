## ⚙️ Setup requirements

To run this project locally, you'll need the following:

- A local server environment such as **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, or **MAMP**
- **phpMyAdmin** to manage the database

### 📦 Database setup

1. Start your local server (e.g., Apache and MySQL in XAMPP).
2. Open **phpMyAdmin** in your browser (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
3. Create a new database (e.g., `bookrates`).
4. Import the provided SQL file if available (`database.sql` or similar).
5. Make sure to update your database connection settings ( `config.php`):

```config.php
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=bookrates

**Run the app:**
